The rise of smartwatches calls for efficient, convenient and suitable text input methods for these small computers. The minuscule size of these screen brings many challenges in how users interact with these devices. Although tech savvy and casual users alike are all familiar with the ubiquitous QWERTY keyboard layout found on most computer keyboards, smartphones, and tablets, this layout cannot fit on small, wearable devices. We introduce \papertitle\, a text input method that uses swipe directions to allow multiple inputs per button and thus allow for an increase in the effective size of input buttons. We have conducted thorough experiments to optimize \papertitle\ to enable a fast, low-error, and easy to learn keyboard for smartwatches. These benefits result from having a keyboard that emphasizes the use of swipe motions. Our user study results show that with a specific combination of swipe direction identification (such as up, down, left, right, and diagonal swipe directions) and its corresponding button size (big, medium, and small button sizes), \papertitle\ users achieved an 55\% improvement in words per minute (WPM) and dramatically decreased error rate by 44\% compared to other text input methods designed for small screens.
